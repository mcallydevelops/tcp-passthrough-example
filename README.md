# tcp-passthrough-example
This is a sample application that will run two "servers".
One server will act as a passthrough server, and the other server will be the destination server. These servers will implement a simple network protocol to prove out the idea of connection to a server through a "proxy". 

**This will not be unit tested for the sake of time**
